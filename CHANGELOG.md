## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Local MCP proxy integration for Codex via Supergateway (STDIO â†” Streamable HTTP/SSE).
- New `alph proxy` commands: `run` and `health`.
- Proxy version pinning (default `supergateway@3.4.0`), override via `--proxy-version` or `ALPH_PROXY_VERSION`.
- Non-interactive proxy flags in `alph setup`: `--proxy-remote-url`, `--proxy-transport`, `--proxy-bearer`, `--proxy-header`.
- Pre-warm step for Windows (`npx -y supergateway --help`) and 60s startup heuristic for `npx`.
- Redaction improvements across previews and logs.
- Health checks and lightweight HTTP/SSE mocks for tests.
- Optional telemetry (disabled by default) with minimal, non-PII counters.

### Docs
- User Guide: proxy usage examples, pinning policy, Windows guidance.
- Troubleshooting: transport mismatch, pin override, rollback.
- ADR-001: decision to adopt Supergateway and prefer Streamable HTTP.


### Fixed
- Claude Code: use `~/.claude.json` on all platforms; add project-scoped MCP servers under `projects[<abs path>].mcpServers` so servers are active per project; adjust list/has to honor project scope.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-01-02

### Fixed
- Fixed Claude Code configuration detection to use correct paths instead of Claude Desktop paths
- Resolved Claude Code MCP server detection and status reporting

### Changed
- Enhanced logger with optional file logging capabilities:
  - Added configurable file output with rotation support
  - Added JSON logging format option
  - Added async file operations with error handling
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing logger API
- Consolidated duplicate `MCPServerConfig` type definitions
- Documentation updated to reflect current CLI:
  - Use `alph setup` (replacing references to `alph configure`)
  - `status` command examples simplified (no `--output` flag)
  - Installation docs use scoped package `@aqualia/alph-cli` and Node.js 18+
- CONTRIBUTING updated: Node 18+ required and pack/install instructions fixed

### Removed
- Removed deprecated `migrate` command and all related files:
  - `src/commands/migrate.ts`
  - `tests/unit/commands/migrate.unit.test.ts` 
  - `tests/integration/cli/migrate.integration.test.ts`
- Removed duplicate `src/enhancedLogger.ts` (functionality integrated into main logger)
- Documentation references to `migrate` removed from `README.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Chore
- Removed unused devDependencies (`@types/inquirer`, `@types/rimraf`)
- Codebase cleanup: removed ~500 lines of dead code
- Consolidated type definitions to eliminate duplication

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-18

### Added
- Subcommand-based CLI (`configure`, `status`) via `src/commands/unified.ts`.
- Access key support for MCP servers with automatic redaction in all outputs.
- Interactive wizard improvements: prefilled values, masked access key prompt.

### Security
- Secrets and access keys redacted consistently (show only last 4) across CLI previews and status output.

## Migration Guide

### From askhumanctl (Go) to alph-cli (NPM)

1. **Uninstall old binary**:
   ```bash
   # Remove from PATH or delete binary
   ```

2. **Install new NPM package**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g alph-cli
   ```

3. **Update commands**:
   ```bash
   # Old command
   askhumanctl setup --mcp-server-id id --mcp-access-key key
   
   # New command  
   alph setup --mcp-server-endpoint https://askhuman.net/mcp/id --bearer key -y
   ```

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   alph --help
   ```

All functionality remains the same, only the installation method and command name have changed.
